This is a simple application designed to fetch a captcha from a page, OCR it, solve it, and post the answer.

This will be handy whenever I need to OCR stuff, or just need to make python http bots


Installation
------------

    pip install requests
    apt-get install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng
